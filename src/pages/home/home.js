                        Hi there, I'm a manufacturing technician transitioning into full stack web developing. 
                        In my previous work I was responsible for maintaining and repairing large and often dangerous equipment. 
                        Due to this, I developed a keen sense of detail and organization as overlooking some detail, even a seemingly minor one, could have a major effect. 
                        In addition I often had to work very closely with either maintenance or the regular machine operators or both! 
                        Communication was key to making sure we arrived at the correct solution in a timely and efficient manner. 
                        Now Iâ€™m bringing both my communication skills and sense of detail orientation to my budding web development skills.
                    </p>
